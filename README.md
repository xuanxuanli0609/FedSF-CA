# FedHST: Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Learning on Medical Image Segmentation

Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training for medical image segmentation tasks across medical institutions while preserving patient privacy. However, intrinsic heterogeneity in medical image data, spanning domain and class variations, severely degrades federated medical model performance, yet few studies address both simultaneously. In this study, we propose a heterogeneity-aware FL method for medical image segmentation that tackles both domain and class heterogeneity, namely FedHST. To address domain heterogeneity, we propose a domain heterogeneity-aware module that leverages a style transfer model to extract domain-specific style features. With a one-shot communication to the server, it constructs a style library for effective adaptation. Additionally, a class heterogeneity-aware module is introduced to aggregate segmentation models across the clients using the embedded SAN-SAW mechanism, ensuring robust learning across heterogeneous data. Experiments demonstrate that FedHST achieves competitive segmentation performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across datasets from two medical imaging scenarios. Our approach proves effective in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.
